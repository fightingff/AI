***Keep Learning & gaining progress!***

- **Prisoner**(AI player for simulating *Prisoners' Dilemma*)
- **Linear Regression**(My own implementation of *Linear Regression* with *Gradient Descent*)

  - Simple implementation
  - Vectorized implementation with feature scaling(z-score)
  - Dynamic chart for visualizing the process of  gradient descent
- **Logistic Regression**

  - Sigmod function to estimate
  - regularized
  - scattered pictures to visualize the process
